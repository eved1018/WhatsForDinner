Italian Wonderpot
Submitted by Lauren Hamid-Shapiro

Ingredients:
4 cups vegetable broth
2 Tbsp olive oil
12 oz. fettuccine or spaghetti
8 oz. frozen chopped spinach*
1 28oz. can diced tomatoes
1 yellow onion, sliced
4 cloves garlic, sliced
1/2 Tbsp dried basil
1/2 Tbsp dried oregano
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper
freshly cracked black pepper to taste
2 oz. shaved Parmesan

Instructions:
*You can substitute basically any other vegetable or add as many additional vegetables as you want. I usually replace the spinach with carrots, celery, and mushrooms.


1. Add four cups of vegetable broth to a large pot. Break the fettuccine in half and add it to the pot along with the canned tomatoes (with juices), olive oil, frozen spinach, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, red pepper, and some freshly cracked black pepper.


2. Make sure the ingredients are submerged under the liquid, place a lid on top of the pot, and then turn the heat on to high. Allow the pot to come up to a full boil over high heat, then remove the lid and turn the heat down to medium.


3. Allow the pot to continue to boil over medium heat, without a lid, for 10-15 minutes, or until the pasta is cooked and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Stir the pot every few minutes as it cooks to prevent the pasta from sticking to the bottom, but avoid over stirring which can cause the pasta to become sticky.


4.Sprinkle with shaved Parmesan just before serving.

Submitted by Perry Eckman

Ingredients:
Sauce:  
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons minced onion
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 28-ounce cans imported Italian crushed tomatoes
6 leaves fresh basil, torn into small pieces 
Pinch of dried oregano
Salt and ground black pepper


Meatballs:
2 pound ground lean beef
2 large eggs
1 ½ tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
1 small garlic clove, minced
Salt and ground black pepper
2 cups fine dry bread crumbs (start with 1/2 cup at a time)
1 cup extra-virgin olive oil

Instructions:
Make the sauce: Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add onion and sauté until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and sauté just until softened. Add tomatoes with their juice and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until sauce is slightly thickened, about 45 minutes. Add the basil, oregano and salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 1 minute more.


Make the meatballs: In a mixing bowl, combine the beef, eggs, parsley and minced garlic, then salt and pepper as desired. Add the bread crumbs and mix well. Don't over mix!! Gently shape into 1 1/2 -inch meatballs.


Heat oven to 425-450. Prepare a sheet pan with meatballs. Bake for 8-10 minutes, flip halfway. Turn and brown the other sides, about 5 minutes more. Transfer cooked meatballs to the marinara sauce. Mix gently and serve.

Seltzer Challah
Submitted by Shoshana Rapps

Ingredients:
3 Cups Warm Water
2 Cups Plain Seltzer
4 Packets of Active Dry Rapid Rise Yeast
1 ¼ Cups Sugar (2 Tablespoons for the Yeast Mixture and the rest for the Dough Mixture)
1 Cup Canola Oil
½ Cup Honey (Use the same Measuring Cup as the Oil so the Honey slides out)
3 Eggs
2 Tablespoons Salt
5-7 Pound Bag of High Gluten Bread Flour (I use 6-7 pound bags to also have enough for Braiding, and King Arthur’s Bread Flour is the best) 
¼ Cup Canola Oil
1 Egg, lightly beaten +1 Tablespoon Water


Instructions:
In a small bowl, place 1 cup of warm water, the yeast and 2 tablespoons of sugar.
Let it sit for 10-15 minutes, close to a window/the sun. 
In a big metal Challah bowl, place the rest of the water, seltzer, oil, honey,  eggs, the rest of the sugar, and salt, and then mix it all together.
After the yeast mixture has risen and has become bubbly, place that mixture into the liquid mixture in the metal Challah bowl by folding it in. 
Then add one to two cups of flour at a time and incorporate into the liquid mixture, reaching 5 pounds of flour (around 18 cups).
Mix for about 15-20 minutes (I start with a spatula and then once the mixture starts getting thick, I use my hands).
Once the dough has become not sticky to the touch and has taken on almost a ball shape in the bowl, spread the ¼ cup of oil over the top of the dough.
Then, cover the bowl in tin foil for about 20-30 minutes.
After 20-30 minutes, knead the dough again for about 5 minutes, until all the oil has been incorporated.
Cover with Tin Foil again for at least 2 hours (but up to 3 is good).
After 2-3 hours, the dough is ready so you just make a Bracha, do the Hafrasha, and then you are ready to braid! 
Spray tins before putting challah in them so they come out nicely. 
After challah is braided and in the tins, let them rise for 30 minutes and then put them in the oven.
Bake at 350 Degrees for about 40 minutes, but depending on the size of the Challah it could be more or less, so until the outside is golden brown. 


Note: Love this recipe! Also, sometimes I put in chocolate chips and it tastes like cake or everything but the bagel spice on top! Enjoy!
